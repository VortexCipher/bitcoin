# Release process

This document outlines the process for releasing versions of the form `$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH`.

We distinguish between two types of releases: *regular* and *maintenance* releases.
Regular releases are releases of a new major or minor version as well as patches of the most recent release.
Maintenance releases, on the other hand, are required for patches of older releases.

You should coordinate with the other maintainers on the release date, if possible.
