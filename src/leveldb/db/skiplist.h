// Thread safety
// -------------
//
// Writes require external synchronization, most likely a mutex.
// Reads require a guarantee that the SkipList will not be destroyed
// while the read is in progress.  Apart from that, reads progress
// without any internal locking or synchronization.
//
// Invariants:
//
// (1) Allocated nodes are never deleted until the SkipList is
// destroyed.  This is trivially guaranteed by the code since we
// never delete any skip list nodes.
//
// (2) The contents of a Node except for the next/prev pointers are
// immutable after the Node has been linked into the SkipList.
// Only Insert() modifies the list, and it is careful to initialize
// a node and use release-stores to publish the nodes in one or
// more lists.
//
// ... prev vs. next pointer ordering ...
