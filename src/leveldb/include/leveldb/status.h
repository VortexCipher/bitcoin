// A Status encapsulates the result of an operation.  It may indicate success,
// or it may indicate an error with an associated error message.
//
// Multiple threads can invoke const methods on a Status without
// external synchronization, but if any of the threads may call a
// non-const method, all threads accessing the same Status must use
// external synchronization.
