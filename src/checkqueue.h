/**
 * Queue for verifications that have to be performed.
  * The verifications are represented by a type T, which must provide an
  * operator(), returning a bool.
  *
  * One thread (the master) is assumed to push batches of verifications
  * onto the queue, where they are processed by N-1 worker threads. When
  * the master is done adding work, it temporarily joins the worker pool
