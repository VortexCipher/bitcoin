"""Test behavior of headers messages to announce blocks.

Setup:

- Two nodes:
    - node0 is the node-under-test. We create two p2p connections to it. The
      first p2p connection is a control and should only ever receive inv's. The
      second p2p connection tests the headers sending logic.
    - node1 is used to create reorgs.

test_null_locators
==================

Sends two getheaders requests with null locator values. First request's hashstop
value refers to validated block, while second request's hashstop value refers to
a block which hasn't been validated. Verifies only the first request returns
headers.

test_nonnull_locators
=====================

Part 1: No headers announcements before "sendheaders"
a. node mines a block [expect: inv]
   send getdata for the block [expect: block]
b. node mines another block [expect: inv]
   send getheaders and getdata [expect: headers, then block]
c. node mines another block [expect: inv]
   peer mines a block, announces with header [expect: getdata]
d. node mines another block [expect: inv]

Part 2: After "sendheaders", headers announcements should generally work.
a. peer sends sendheaders [expect: no response]
   peer sends getheaders with current tip [expect: no response]
b. node mines a block [expect: tip header]
c. for N in 1, ..., 10:
   * for announce-type in {inv, header}
     - peer mines N blocks, announces with announce-type
       [ expect: getheaders/getdata or getdata, deliver block(s) ]
     - node mines a block [ expect: 1 header ]

Part 3: Headers announcements stop after large reorg and resume after getheaders or inv from peer.
- For response-type in {inv, getheaders}
  * node mines a 7 block reorg [ expect: headers announcement of 8 blocks ]
  * node mines an 8-block reorg [ expect: inv at tip ]
  * peer responds with getblocks/getdata [expect: inv, blocks ]
  * node mines another block [ expect: inv at tip, peer sends getdata, expect: block ]
  * node mines another block at tip [ expect: inv ]
  * peer responds with getheaders with an old hashstop more than 8 blocks back [expect: headers]
  * peer requests block [ expect: block ]
  * node mines another block at tip [ expect: inv, peer sends getdata, expect: block ]
  * peer sends response-type [expect headers if getheaders, getheaders/getdata if mining new block]
  * node mines 1 block [expect: 1 header, peer responds with getdata]
