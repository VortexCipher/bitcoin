"""Test-only implementation of low-level secp256k1 field and group arithmetic

It is designed for ease of understanding, not performance.

WARNING: This code is slow and trivially vulnerable to side channel attacks. Do not use for
anything but tests.

Exports:
* FE: class for secp256k1 field elements
* GE: class for secp256k1 group elements
* G: the secp256k1 generator point
