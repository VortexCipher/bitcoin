"""Test HD Wallet keypool restore function.

Two nodes. Node1 is under test. Node0 is providing transactions and generating blocks.

- Start node1, shutdown and backup wallet.
- Generate 110 keys (enough to drain the keypool). Store key 90 (in the initial keypool) and key 110 (beyond the initial keypool). Send funds to key 90 and key 110.
