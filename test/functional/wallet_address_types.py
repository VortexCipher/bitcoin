"""Test that the wallet can send and receive using all combinations of address types.

There are 5 nodes-under-test:
    - node0 uses legacy addresses
    - node1 uses p2sh/segwit addresses
    - node2 uses p2sh/segwit addresses and bech32 addresses for change
    - node3 uses bech32 addresses
    - node4 uses a p2sh/segwit addresses for change

node5 exists to generate new blocks.

## Multisig address test

Test that adding a multisig address with:
    - an uncompressed pubkey always gives a legacy address
    - only compressed pubkeys gives the an `-addresstype` address

## Sending to address types test

A series of tests, iterating over node0-node4. In each iteration of the test, one node sends:
    - 10/101th of its balance to itself (using getrawchangeaddress for single key addresses)
    - 20/101th to the next node
    - 30/101th to the node after that
    - 40/101th to the remaining node
    - 1/101th remains as fee+change

Iterate over each node for single key addresses, and then over each node for
multisig addresses.

Repeat test, but with explicit address_type parameters passed to getnewaddress
and getrawchangeaddress:
    - node0 and node3 send to p2sh.
    - node1 sends to bech32.
    - node2 sends to legacy.
