"""Test node responses to invalid blocks.

In this test we connect to one node over p2p, and test block requests:
1) Valid blocks should be requested and become chain tip.
2) Invalid block with duplicated transaction should be re-requested.
3) Invalid block with bad coinbase value should be rejected and not
re-requested.
4) Invalid block due to future timestamp is later accepted when that timestamp
becomes valid.
