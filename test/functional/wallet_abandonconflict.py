"""Test the abandontransaction RPC.

 The abandontransaction RPC marks a transaction and all its in-wallet
 descendants as abandoned which allows their inputs to be respent. It can be
 used to replace "stuck" or evicted transactions. It only works on transactions
 which are not included in a block and are not currently in the mempool. It has
 no effect on transactions which are already abandoned.
