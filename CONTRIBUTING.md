Contributing to Bitcoin Core
============================

The Bitcoin Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
contributing.

First, in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Bitcoin Core
developers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally
revolves around a meritocracy where contributors earn trust from the developer
community over time. Nevertheless, some hierarchy is necessary for practical
purposes. As such, there are repository maintainers who are responsible for
merging pull requests, the [release cycle](/doc/release-process.md), and
moderation.

Getting Started
---------------

New contributors are very welcome and needed.

Reviewing and testing is highly valued and the most effective way you can contribute
as a new contributor. It also will teach you much more about the code and
process than opening pull requests. Please refer to the [peer review](#peer-review)
section below.

Before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Bitcoin Core build
system and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build
Bitcoin Core and how to run the unit tests, functional tests, and fuzz tests.

There are many open issues of varying difficulty waiting to be fixed.
If you're looking for somewhere to start contributing, check out the
[good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
list or changes that are
[up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22).
Some of them might no longer be applicable. So if you are interested, but
unsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.

You may also participate in the weekly
[Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/) meeting.

The purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are
