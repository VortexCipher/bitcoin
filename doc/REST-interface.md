Unauthenticated REST Interface
==============================

The REST API can be enabled with the `-rest` option.

The interface runs on the same port as the JSON-RPC interface, by default port 8332 for mainnet, port 18332 for testnet,
port 48332 for testnet4, port 38332 for signet, and port 18443 for regtest.

REST Interface consistency guarantees
-------------------------------------

The [same guarantees as for the RPC Interface](/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md#rpc-consistency-guarantees)
apply.
