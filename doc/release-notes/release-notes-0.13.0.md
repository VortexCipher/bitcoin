Compatibility
==============

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
an OS initially released in 2001. This means that not even critical security
updates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin
wallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.

In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core
randomly crashing on Windows XP. It is [not clear](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7681#issuecomment-217439891)
what the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream
libraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.

We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is
end-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are
suggested to upgrade to a newer verion of Windows, or install an alternative OS
that is supported.

No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,
you can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not
report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Notable changes
===============

Database cache memory increased
--------------------------------

As a result of growth of the UTXO set, performance with the prior default
database cache of 100 MiB has suffered.
For this reason the default was changed to 300 MiB in this release.

For nodes on low-memory systems, the database cache can be changed back to
100 MiB (or to another value) by either:

- Adding `dbcache=100` in bitcoin.conf
- Changing it in the GUI under `Options â†’ Size of database cache`

Note that the database cache setting has the most performance impact
during initial sync of a node, and when catching up after downtime.


bitcoin-cli: arguments privacy
------------------------------

The RPC command line client gained a new argument, `-stdin`
to read extra arguments from standard input, one per line until EOF/Ctrl-D.
For example:

    $ src/bitcoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase
    mysecretcode
    120
    ..... press Ctrl-D here to end input
    $

It is recommended to use this for sensitive information such as wallet
passphrases, as command-line arguments can usually be read from the process
table by any user on the system.


C++11 and Python 3
------------------

Various code modernizations have been done. The Bitcoin Core code base has
started using C++11. This means that a C++11-capable compiler is now needed for
building. Effectively this means GCC 4.7 or higher, or Clang 3.3 or higher.

When cross-compiling for a target that doesn't have C++11 libraries, configure with
`./configure --enable-glibc-back-compat ... LDFLAGS=-static-libstdc++`.

For running the functional tests in `qa/rpc-tests`, Python3.4 or higher is now
